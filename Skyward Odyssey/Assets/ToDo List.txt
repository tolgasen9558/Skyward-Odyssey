****** To Do's *****

->Ranged enemy attack
    ->Need to animate the weapon

->Level Design
	->Parallax?

->Boss room (incorporate 3 types of enemies into boss)

->Camera adjustments
    ->Smoothen the camera movement
    ->Adjust the viewport to see a bigger portion of the level
    ->Clamp the camera position on the edges of the levels


->Set different attack method's damages differently


****** Bugs ******

-> Ranger enemy doesn't turn to face the player before it fires


-> Enemy rigidbody type
    ->Gravity doesn affect the current enemy since it is kinematic
      But if we change the body type to dynamic, it can be easily 
      pushed by player
    ->Freezing x position blocks the patroling code, so its not 
      a good solution, one dirty hack could be setting the mass 
      of the enemies too high so they win the collisions
